!When in "enable mode" this command will allow configuration commands
!to be entered at the terminal, i.e. via a console connection.
!This here so that this configuration can be copied and pasted into a
!console window after entering "enable"
!
!This configuration defines two networks, 192.168.1.0 and .2.0 with
!associated DHCP pools. The GE1-4 interfaces get addresses from .1.0
!network, and the GOS the .2.2 address.
!
!Note that these address ranges are being used as they should be
!private as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918
!
!These commands are provided as comments as they are often required
!in development as new images are provided.

!
!See install commands above. If new images are installed, then the
!boot image will typically need to be updated also.

!These credentials are used to authenticate to the Local Manager web
!application at https://<GOS IP address>:8443. Note that this
!configuration file, by default, gives the GOS an IP address of 192.168.2.2
!EDIT ME! Change these credentials.

!Set the enable password.
!EDIT ME! Change these credentials.

!The two exclusion commands below ensure that the only address in the
!192.168.2.0 DHCP pool will be 192.168.2.2. This means that the GOS,
!will always have that address from the GuestOS-pool, defined below.
!
!EDIT ME! If you need to use a different address range or network for
!the GOS. For example, if before you do any of this, you can ping
!192.168.2.2 from your laptop, then there is already something in your
!environment that uses that address, so you will need to change that
!here. Also see ip routes below.
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.2.1
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.2.3 192.168.2.254
!
!This is the DHCP pool from which the GOS address will be
!assigned. Because of the "excluded-address" commands above, the GOS
!will always get 192.168.2.2.
!
ip dhcp pool GuestOS-pool
 network 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.2.1 
 lease infinite
 exit
!
!This is the DHCP pool for the GE1-4 ports. By default addresses will
!be assigned starting from 192.168.1.2.
!EDIT ME! If you have this network or addresses already in use in
!your environment. Also see "interface Vlan2" and ip routes below.
!

!
!This is a VLAN defined for configuring the GE1-4 switch ports below.
!The address of the VLAN matches the DHCP Internal-pool defined above.
!EDIT ME! If you have this network or addresses already in use in
!your environment. Note that the "description" value is informational
!only. It should be changed if you change the network number, but has no operational impact.
!
!Note that there is some syntactical configuration magic here.
!Vlan2 is the name of the "interface", but what is
!really going on is a mechanism to create global settings for
!"vlan 2" which is then used to configure GE1-4.
