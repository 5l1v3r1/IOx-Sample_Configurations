!This configuration defines two networks, 10.42.1.0 and 10.42.2.0 with
!associated DHCP pools. The GE1-4 interfaces get addresses from the 10.42.1
!network, and the GOS the 10.42.2.2 address.
!
!To ensure that these networks are reachable from your laptop, you may
!need to use this command, in OS X, to set up a route:
!
!sudo route -n add -net 10.42.0.0/16  10.42.1.1
!
!In Linux the format is:
!
!sudo route add -net 10.42.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0  gw 10.42.1.1
!
!Note that these address ranges are being used as they should be
!private as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918. My 
!network is 10.41.136.0, so I know that 10.42 is available
!in my environment. Similar considerations may apply for you.
!
!These install commands are provided as comments as they are often required
!in development as new images are provided. Note that the images
!referred to have to be in the flash memory.
!
guest-os 1 stop
guest-os 1 image uninstall
bundle install flash:/ir800-universalk9-bundle.SPA.156-1.T1.bin
guest-os 1 image install flash:/ir800-ioxvm-1.0.0.4-T.bin verify
!
!See install commands above. If new images are installed, then the
!boot image will typically need to be updated also.
!
!boot system flash:/ir800-universalk9-mz.SPA.156-1.T1
!
!Enable additional debugging (optional, but useful)
!

!Set the hostname. EDIT ME!
!

!
!These credentials are used to authenticate to the Local Manager web
!application at https://<GOS IP address>:8443. Note that this
!configuration file, by default, gives the GOS an IP address of 10.42.2.2
!EDIT ME! Change these credentials.
!
username cisco privilege 15 password 0 cisco
!
!Set the enable password.
!EDIT ME! Change these credentials.
!
enable password cisco123
!         
!The two exclusion commands below ensure that the only address in the
!10.42.2.0 DHCP pool will be 10.42.2.2. This means that the GOS,
!will always have that address from the GuestOS-pool, defined below.
!
!EDIT ME! If you need to use a different address range or network for
!the GOS. For example, if before you do any of this, you can ping
!10.42.2.2 from your laptop, then there is already something in your
!environment that uses that address, so you will need to change that
!here. Also see ip routes below.
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.42.2.1
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.42.2.3 10.42.2.254
!
!This is the DHCP pool from which the GOS address will be
!assigned. Because of the "excluded-address" commands above, the GOS
!will always get 10.42.2.2.
!
ip dhcp pool GuestOS-pool
 network 10.42.2.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 10.42.2.1 
 lease infinite
 exit
!
!This is the DHCP pool for the GE0-1 ports. By default addresses will
!be assigned starting from 10.42.1.2.
!EDIT ME! If you have this network or addresses already in use in
!your environment. Also see "interface BVI1" and ip routes below.
!         
ip dhcp pool Internal-pool
 network 10.42.1.0 255.255.255.0

!These commands configure the bridging behaviour. They are required
!*before* the "BVI1" interface can be configured below.

!
!This is a Bridged Virtual Interface (BVI) defined for configuring the GE1-0 ports below.
!The address of the BVI matches the DHCP Internal-pool defined above.
!EDIT ME! If you have this network or addresses already in use in
!your environment. Note that the "description" value is informational
!only. It should be changed if you change the network number, but has no operational impact.
!
!Note that there is some syntactical configuration magic here.
!BVI1 is the name of the "interface", but what is
!really going on is a mechanism to create global settings for
!"bridge-group 1" which is then used to configure GE0-1.
